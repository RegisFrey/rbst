// tokens can be resolved to fully specified tokens
// Basic Resolution works:
// result of resolveTokens() is a ResolvedTokenGroup

// EXPORTED vs NON-EXPORTED
// all exported tokens are present
// all non-exported tokens are removed

// TYPES
// implicit types (from js types) are made explicit in data

// UNITS
// implicit units are extracted
// explicit units are preserved
// explicit and implicit units throw error

// COMMENTS
// comments are preserved by default
// comments can be stripped for production



// GROUPS
// groups can be resolved with any group properties being applied to the members of the group
